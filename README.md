# Voting Theory

This repository contains a presentation on voting theory with a algorithm of Instant Runoff Voting (IRV)

## Introduction

Voting theory is the branch of social choice theory that studies methods, algorithms, and principles for aggregating individual preferences into collective decisions. It seeks to understand and analyze the mechanisms by which societies make choices through elections or other decision-making processes.

## Voting Methods

The presentation covers various voting methods, including:

* Plurality voting
* Approval voting
* Borda count
* Instant-runoff voting (IRV)

## Complexity Analysis

The complexity of each voting method is analyzed in terms of:

* Tabulating votes
* Eliminating candidates (for IRV)
* Redistributing votes (for IRV)

## Conclusion

The study of voting theory is essential for designing fair and representative elections. The choice of voting method depends on the specific context of the election and the desired outcomes.
